--- Credit/History/Contact ---

Slingshot was created by Jonathan Musther and Bart Mak.
The old website used to be www.slingshot-game.org

Slingshot was unmaintained by 2008 and the old website had disappeared by
2008/2009.

It was later extended in 2009 by Marcus Dreier <m-rei@gmx.net>. He:
 - Added network support
 - Fixed crashing when pressing cursors at welcome and help screen
 - Added fine adjustments for all keyboard bindings (shift, ctrl, alt)
 - Replaced the deprecated range function with xrange
 - Removed some of pygame's deprecation warnings
 - Switched to a more consistent code format

Slingshot is currently maintained by Ryan Kavanagh <ryanakca@kubuntu.org>. If
someone is interested in helping with upstream maintainership and give slingshot
some love, please feel free.

Slingshot is a two-dimensional strategy game where two players attempt to shoot
one another through a section of space populated by planets.  The main feature
of the game is that the shots, once fired, are affected by the gravity of the
planets.
